# [Ronan Flynn's](http://flynnduism.com) [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) Theme & Settings

![https://hostr.co/file/xiyn5yMydJUS/sublime.png](https://hostr.co/file/xiyn5yMydJUS/sublime.png)

I've had some folks enquire about the color and styling settings I'm using for Sublime Text, to match [the custom icon I designed](http://dribbble.com/shots/1069298-Sublime-Text-Icon-Redux?list=show) for the program.

This repo includes my settings file, as well as a modified version of Chris Kempson's excellent [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme, which I edited to my preferred shades.

### Dependancies

1. Install the [DejaVu Sans Mono Font](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page)
2. Install the [Soda UI theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/)


## Suggestion

Instead of doing the above, you'll probably want to fork the repository and use your fork instead of mine. That'll allow you to push your changes back.
